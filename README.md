# Simplified-Train-Ticket-Booking-System
Implemention of a  simplified Client/Server train ticket booking system.

Both the instructions in the software and the comments of the program are mainly in Chinese.


Notice:

Before running the Train_Server, you need to have access to the corresponding database "Access". And then you need to put the Database1.accdb in a proper place and change the corresponding address in Train_server(Form2.cs, Form3.cs and Form6.cs). 

Before running the The_Trainbooking_Server, you need to have the Train_Server running corrextly and connecting to Internet. Then you need to change the target IP "TIP" in Server.cs in The_Trainbooking_Server to the IP of the Train_Server which must be a constant value.

As for the password, you need to check the Database1.accdb to find the username and the password for each account. And you need to check Form1.cs in Train_Server to find the password for the server.

Actually, this version is not fully completed for it's done in a few days, so it has only a few functions and may have some problems. I just release this program to commemorate that period and give novices like me a example of how to do program like this.


Finished in 2017.
